# Challenges_of_Motherhood-Young_MUMs_urgent_Questions

The birth of a child changes everyday life completely and many unanswered questions in dealing with a newborn might appear. The organization “Österreichischer Kinderschutzpreis - Verein zur Förderung von Kinderschutz und Kindergesundheit in Österreich” wants to find out which questions are in fact really important to a majority of young mothers to be able to provide them professional help. 
Therefore, the aim is to find out: 

What are the challenges of motherhood? Which questions concern young mothers?

Based on Facebook data that is extracted with the help of the platform CrowdTangle, two topic modeling techniques are used: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic.
While LDA could not extract meaningful topics, the more advanced method BERTopic found clear, interpretable and appropriate topics. When using a reduced, clean dataset of around 6000 Facebook posts BERTopic could extract almost 50 different topics. Based on these results the organization “Österreichischer Kinderschutzpreis” will produce a brochure with answers to the questions of the different topics from experts.
